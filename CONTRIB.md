## Design

Try to keep the audience(s) in mind.

The purpose of this website is to provide information to the people visiting it.

Different people will be looking for different information. An attempted taxonomy is below, to hilight the kinds of information we expect people to be looking for.

### User Taxonomy

1) random local techie
2) prospective user group / event organizer
3) existing unaffiliated organizer
4) newsie / non-tech community organizer
5) has specific MTF questions (meeting minutes, board structure, etc)
6) anyone else / John Q. Public

Note this doesn't include anyone affiliated / in-the-know, as I'm assuming they'd be on Slack instead.
