<h2>ATHENA{techne} Hackathon</h2>
<p>Are you a woman who has tried to write your own software or build your own electronic gadget?  If so, you'll know that itâ€™s difficult, 
and it can take more time or planning than you expected.  So, what can you do about it?  Many people have found success by bringing such 
ideas to a hackathon.  Do you know what a "hackathon" is?  It is best described as an "invention marathon."  Normally, it is a weekend 
where like-minded people come together to collaborate about the process, to turn an idea into a tangible product, and to share that 
experience with people like you!  If this concept interests you, you should know that ATHENA{techne} is coming up July 20-21 at the 
University of Memphis FedEx Institute of Technology!</p>

<p>ATHENA{techne} is working with local tech organizations to bring the first women's hackathon to Memphis!  It will be a free event to 
encourage women interested in the possibility of technology to come together, collaborate on their projects, and build opportunities for 
women in the Memphis technology market!  If you don't know how to code or how to wire gadgets, it isn't a problem!  Being new at a hackathon 
is entirely irrelevant to what you will experience when you attend!  It is more about your interest in technology and curiosity to discover 
what is out there.  All you need is to bring some passion for learning at a welcoming and beginner-friendly event.  Even if you do not know 
anyone attending, you can rest assured that it is perfectly normal to look for a team or to ask for help on your project.  ATHENA{techne} 
will also offer a team-matching session to help you hit the ground running and maximize your time and experience efficiently!  </p>
